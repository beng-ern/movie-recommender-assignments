# KSE643 Knowledge Engineering and Intelligent Decision Making
A collection of codes developed for assignments of "Knowledge Engineering and Intelligent Decision Making" class, most of the codes are about the movie recommender system.
(these codes were developed during my first semester, when I first learnt about Python programming language)

## Using movielens-100k dataset from Kaggle

### 3 types of recommender systems:
1. User-based / Item-based collaborative recommender system
2. Content-based recommender system (plot, synopsis, keywords)
3. Autoencoder for user-based recommender system
